Hello world!

This is my first JS project! :tada:

It took me a day and a half to complete it, I wanted to give up and check the "How To" tutorial 30+ times, 
but I console.logged & googled my way through it, finally got it to work and I couldn't be more proud. :metal:

I know that JS code looks like :shit: right now, but I'll make it pretty and optimized, I promise. :hand:
